Note that you'll need to replace the region, filename, event_source_arn, bucket, 
and policy_arn values with appropriate values for your use case. Additionally, 
you may want to customize the handler, timeout, memory_size, 
and reserved_concurrent_executions values to suit your needs.
 
Finally, you'll need to ensure that the filename value references a valid ZIP file 
containing the Lambda function's code.
